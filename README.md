Use this repl as a template for freeglut OpenGL development in repl

The included script checks if the correct freeglut/GL packages are installed. If the modules are not present, it installs them.

If you edit the fractals.c program and re-run the script, it will re-compile your program and back up the old version in the "backup" folder, versioning it with the current date and time. This will allow you to make live edits and revert on repl without much work.

The gcc command for compiling / linking isn't quite correct but works for some examples
